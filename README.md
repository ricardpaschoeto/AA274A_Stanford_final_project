# Autonomous Food Delivery

The final project will be based on Autonomous Food Delivery! You will be expected to (1) explore an unknown environment and locate all the food vendors around the city, then (2) given a food request from your hungry TAs, your robot will need to autonomously pick up the food and deliver it back to the home base.
